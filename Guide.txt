Hi there, Here are the things which you have to do during the setup of this app in your home environment 
So after downloading the ZIP file Run the following command. 

Open Up a terminal and Write 
1. npm i

Then after It completes the operation 
Run the following command 
2. npm run dev

if everything gone correct. You can see 2 message saying. 
1. Congratulations the app is listening at Port 3300
2. Connection Succesfull

Once you see these messages. Open up any browser and go to 
localhost:3300

And one thing the admin panel is at localhost:3300:admin

Go their to see the details of the people signed up to this app. 


And bro genuinely speaking I did little bit late. Which I think I shouldn't do. But anyways I have given my best to serve 
you better. So I hope this time everything will be done. And brother I request you. as I did in lill cheap price please please 
if you can give me a good rating of 5 star. Thanks and as a compensation I would like to give you free support for 3 months 
with this app. And also this is Halloween season. Think that the admin panel and this free support is your present for this 
holiday. Okay
Thanks 
Yours sincerly
