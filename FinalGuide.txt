Hi There, 
	As you requested a guide to perform some basic operations. So here it is. 

Here are the sollution to your doubts. 
Follow these 

1. How to change the title content of music page?
=> First of all open the main folder ie, cftaxes-music after that go to the views folder and open the file saying index. 
After that in the index file search for "h1.heading A Very Nice Music App" once found. Change the content to the one you like 
for example "h1.heading Hello World". The heading will say hello world. I hope this doubt is cleared

2. How to add more musics to this app ?
=> To do this you have to go to the public folder and inside the public folder you have to go the js folder. Then find the 
file saying music-list. After that Paste the following code 

  {
     name: "Here is the music name",
     artist: "Here is the artist name",
     img: "image name here - remember img must be in .jpg formate and it's inside the images folder of this project folder",
    src: "music name here - remember img must be in .mp3 formate and it's inside the songs folder of this project folder"
   }

Replace the instruction with the data. Ideally on the img value enter the image/thumbnail name and same in the case of src 
value. Okay. Thats all for this. 

3. How to change the Video?
=> First Download the video you like and after that. You should go to the public folder and there you just need to paste it
And NOTE:- Make sure to rename the video to demo-video okay. 

Thats all to change the video.
